            <h2 class="text-danger">Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>This Web site is protected under the copyright laws of Canada and other countries and Invis Inc. shall legally enforce its rights concerning the content contained herein. Except for personal or non-commercial use, no person has permission to republish or reproduce the contents in any form or by any means without prior written consent from Invis Inc.</p>
            <p>At Invis Inc. ("Invis"), we are committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of the personal information of our clients (individually, the "Client" and collectively, the "Clients".) As financial service providers, we have a professional obligation to maintain in confidence information we receive within our role as a financial services provider. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to advise you as to why we ask for personal information, how we use it, what safeguards we employ, and how to contact us with privacy-related matters.</p>

            <strong>What is personal information?</strong>
            <p>In this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means information that is gathered in connection with an application, pre-approval, request for information for a mortgage(s) or loan(s) and insurance or other product through Invis or Invis affiliate and is provided to, or collected by, Invis and its staff or by Invis' agents, associates, and affiliates on Invis' behalf (collectively, "Invis").</p>

            <strong>Why does Invis collect personal information?</strong>

            <p>Invis collects and uses Personal Information for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Providing mortgage brokering services to the Client and offer products and services best suited to their needs, including arranging and/or renewing loan(s)/mortgage(s), informing the client of group creditor insurance and other products offered or approved by Invis or its affiliates that may be of interest to the Client;</li>
                <li>Checking Client credit worthiness through credit bureau inquiry and personal information agents who have information on a Client's financial position.</li>
                <li>Auditing the services provided to our Clients, compliance with all municipal, provincial, federal and other applicable laws and other specific purposes which are communicated to the Client by a member of Invis before collection of such Personal Information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Except when otherwise permitted by law, we will only use a Client's Personal Information for the purposes identified to the Client. When Personal Information is to be used for a purpose not identified, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that new purpose is identified prior to use.</p>

            <strong>How does Invis collect personal information?</strong>
            <p>The Client is our main source of information. With the Client's consent, we may also obtain information directly from a third party to help us determine your eligibility for various financial products and services. For credit matters, for example, it is essential that we know your financial worth as well as your credit record. We will also contact other lenders, financial institutions, credit bureaus and employers. Your consent is therefore important because without it, we will not be able to carry out the appropriate inquiries and it might be difficult for us to offer you the credit product you request. In most cases, your consent is given on the forms used for specific products or, from time to time, on a separate form. You will notice that the declaration of consent is clear and unambiguous.</p>

            <strong>Consent</strong>
            <p>Your provision of Personal Information to Invis means that you agree and consent that Invis can collect, use and disclose your Personal Information in compliance with this Privacy Policy. Invis will not collect, use or disclose a Client's Personal Information without the Client's requisite consent, except in certain extraordinary circumstances. Such extraordinary circumstances shall include without limitation, when legal, medical or security reasons make it impossible or impractical to obtain consent or where it is otherwise in the best interests of the Client.</p>
            <p>The most common method we use to obtain a Client's consent is by way of the Client's consent as confirmed by the application. Where practicable, we may also obtain a Client's consent through oral communications or other written documentation. Our Clients may withdraw their consent by written notice to us at any time, subject to any legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. A Client's refusal to provide, or subsequent withdrawal of, his or her consent may affect Invis' ability to provide the Client with mortgage services. A member of Invis will inform the Client of the implications of such withdrawal. To withdraw consent, Client should contact the Chief Privacy Officer in writing at:</p>

                <li>when mortgage services by Invis are provided to a Client requiring us to give Personal Information about a Client to a third party (for example, to a lender in a real estate mortgage transaction) the Client's consent will be implied, unless the Client tells us otherwise;</li>
                <li>where it is necessary to pull a credit bureau for purposes of processing a mortgage transaction;</li>
                <li>if Invis engages a third party to provide administrative or support services (such as computer back-up services, shredding or archival file storage) and the third party is bound by our Privacy Policy;</li>
                <li>protection of Invis' best interests</li>
                <li>protection of public interests such as the denouncement of criminal activity such as fraud or money laundering. In all such cases, authorities are contacted and personal information may be disclosed or if we retain a law firm(s) to act on our behalf for any reason;</li>
                <li>if the information is already publicly known.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In addition, if you are a British Columbia Client, your Personal Information will be provided to your Invis agent (and a copy retained by Invis for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy) in the event of his or her departure from Invis, in order to meet your ongoing financial needs.
